#Architecture

The Calendar View project follows a modular architecture.
Each componentâ€”such as the header, day grid, and event cellâ€”is designed for reusability and scalability.
React manages the state efficiently to ensure smooth transitions when switching months or adding events.
Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent and responsive layout across all screen sizes.
Storybook is integrated to document, visualize, and test UI components in isolation.
